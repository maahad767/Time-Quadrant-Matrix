# Project Description
This is a very simple project. A student(anyone can use aswell) just need to register to use this project. 
He will then add his task providing task name, deadline, category and priority. However, this app is some kind of intellegent. 
It can detect if user task name has any keyword which matches keywords defined in the app as high priority or falls in any pre-defined category. 
That's all a user have to do. The web-app will do the rest. It will give the user which task to do right now, which one to avoid using 
time management matrix.
